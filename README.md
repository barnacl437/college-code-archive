# The barn's College Code Archive(tm)(r)(c)(p)
An archive/aggregation of my coding practices (learnt/studied mostly during my college time).
This repository was created at the first intention of building a python (rather than any programming language) code practice samples. however, it is now designated to accept any results from my journey of learning how to code.

this repo is still a stub and waiting for expansions in the future.
